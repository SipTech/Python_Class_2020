# Python Class 2020

During the 2020 COVID lockdown, I ran a small Python programming class for a group of ~15 students.

We followed the HomeAndLearn syllabus and focused on practical fundamentals:

* Variables & data types
* Control flow
* Functions
* Basic OOP
* Problem solving exercises

Classes were held twice weekly (2–3 hours per session), and this repository contains the exercises, examples, and demo code used during those sessions.

## Why this exists

The goal was simple:

* Help beginners get started with Python
* Build confidence through hands-on coding
* Create structure during a chaotic time

## Who this is for

- Beginners learning Python
- Self-taught developers wanting simple examples
- Anyone looking for readable, practical starter code

This repo remains public as a reference for newcomers looking for simple, readable Python examples.

## Tech

* Python 3.x
* Console-based exercises
